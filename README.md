 # Overview 

 This repository is the implementation of the paper "IDEAL: Interpretable-by-design deep learning algorithms".

The proposed IDEAL framework considers separately the representations from the latent spaces, learnt on generic large data sets, and learning of an interpretable, prototype-based model within this data space.
